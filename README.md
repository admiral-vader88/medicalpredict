# Leveraging Machine Learning for Disease Prediction Based on Symptoms
**Title: Leveraging Machine Learning for Disease Prediction Based on Symptoms**

The provided code snippet demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) in predicting diseases based on symptoms. Through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, it showcases the potential of machine learning in healthcare for accurate diagnosis. The code also allows for real-time prediction of diseases given new symptoms, highlighting its relevance in enhancing medical decision-making processes.

patientdata is the training dataset 
newdataset is test dataset
they are in a 80:20 train:test ratio
data is not accurate 



**MODEL RESULTS DEPEND ON DATASET GIVEN**
